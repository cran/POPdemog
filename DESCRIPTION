Maintainer: Ying Zhou <yz001@uw.edu>
Description: Plot demographic graphs for single/multiple populations from coalescent simulation program input. Currently, this package can support the 'ms', 'msHot', 'MaCS', 'msprime', 'SCRM', and 'Cosi2' simulation programs. It does not check the simulation program input for correctness, but assumes the simulation program input has been validated by the simulation program. More features will be added to this package in the future, please check the 'GitHub' page for the latest updates: <https://github.com/YingZhou001/POPdemog>.
